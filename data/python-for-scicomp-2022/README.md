## Most positive feedback

The following are comments about the format of the course, not about
individual lessons.  Thus, these are focused on 

> Best course I’ve taken all year, thanks so much everyone! +2

> Thank you for providing this course! You show some really nice tips,
> know-how (e.g., advanced numpy). Much appreciated that you organise
> this! +3

> I like it better than a live lecture course. It is more flexible and
I prefer coding in my litle cave, but you have still made it nice and
interactive :) +3

> The fact that you guys are working in pairs and play
> “teacher/student” is amazing! It really helps keeing the right
> tempo +4

> I like livestreaming as you can have multiple levels in the course
> depending on your background. Like this document, where you can ask
> also more advanced questions. +1 (livestreaming is so much more
> flexible. Lecture halls are easily dominated by one or a few
> students - whose questions others might find not
> interesting/important)

> It’s probably not as good as in a lecture hall in terms of >
> engagement, but the fact that we can ask live questions in the
> Hedgedoc that you guys address (!) makes it way better than just a
> standard online course

> The best thing in general was the senior programmers did best to
> deliver the complicated subjects very professionally to the variety of
> levels of programmers.

Negative feedback:

> Getting sucked in to coding and noticing that you have not been
following for last 15 minutes and have no idea what is happening +3

> not bothered to try the exercises, getting numb

> This is a very minor comment, but I think it would be better if
> there was a clearer “leader” for the sessions, and that the
> co-presenter were a bit more quite. Sometimes the co-presenter said
> things that interupted the main-presenter, even just things like “yes,
> aha” and so one can be distracting when the presentation gets abruptly
> interupted.

> More time to get through all the intended material.
